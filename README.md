# legislative_data

To run the project:

```
or 
```

### The project:

* controller.py:
    The controller gets the external data from the provided csv's and injects in the system.

* service.py:
    The service layer apply the business rules in the data from the controller and build the requested outputs.


### Questions:

    * 1. I chose a simpler architecture
    * 2. This is an easy change, I would add a data attribute and co-sponsors in the bill object
    * 3. In a similar way I would skip the step of extracting the list from csv
    * 4. 3:30 to 4 hours

### Outputs:

Output files in repository/output
